<p>Instructions : 1/5</p>

<p>Your task is to translate English sentences into emoji.</p>

<p>The sentences are simple so you will only need to use two emoji in your translations.</p>

<p>To translate the English sentence, first read it carefully.</p>

<p>Then look at the available emoji.</p>

<p>Next, drag two emoji into the square area in the middle.</p>

<p>Click "Continue" to move to the next sentence.</p>

<p><b>Mobile users</b>: you may need to scroll down a little to see the "Continue" button!</p>
